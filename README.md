# fcc-grid-magazine-layout
praciticing building grid layouts and just trying to get the overall hang of it. Need more practice but getting the concept. 
-centering based on wrapper and not on the body still need to dig on that if its proper to but display: flex on the body or not.
-fromt there pretty simple main the main element into a grid and set grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, then naming them through grid-area with the same classes to make it easy for how much to spna within its row and column.
